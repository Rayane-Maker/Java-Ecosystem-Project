                            * Pond Travel *

You're an amphibian! Reach the top side of the pond, row by row of water lilies.
Each row represents a stage where you must make a choice: you can decide which
water lily to jump to for the next row or attempt to eat any potential insects on
the current water lily.

But be cautious! Some water lilies conceal venomous insects that can harm you.
If you proceed to the next stage without eating, you'll have to consume on the
subsequent water lily, so plan your strategy wisely!

Eat insects make you grow.
