------------------------------- Game Instructions -------------------------------

You're a sight-impaired amphibian, but you have a good hear! Reach the top side
of the pond, row by row of water lilies. Each row represents a stage where you
must make a choice: you can decide which water lily to jump to for the next row or
attempt to eat any potential insects on the current water lily.

Eat insects make you grow. Press 'e' to eat;
To quit the game press 'p'.
